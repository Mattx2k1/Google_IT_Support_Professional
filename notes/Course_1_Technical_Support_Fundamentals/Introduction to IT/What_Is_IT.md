# What is IT?

Information Technology - The use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information 

The IT industry refers to the entire scope of all the jobs and resources that are related to computing technologies within society. 
Job examples:

  Network Engineers - who ensure computers can communicate with each other
  Hardware Technicians - who can replace and repair components
  Desktop Support - who make sure that end users can use their software properly

IT isn’t just about building computers and the internet, it’s really about people. That’s the heart and soul of IT support work.

## What good is technology or information if people can’t use technology or make sense of the information?

IT helps people solve meaningful problems by using technology which is why you’ll see its influences in:
  Education
  Medicine
  Journalism
  Construction
  Transportation
  Entertainment
  Any industry

IT is about changing the world through the ways we collaborate, share, and create together. 

## Digital Divide

Growing skills gap between those with digital literacy and those with limited or none. People without digital literacy skills are falling behind
There are many social and economic reasons why some people have digital literacy skills and other people do not
Maybe you’re from a community where there  wasn’t any internet or you couldn’t afford a super-fast computer and had to use one at your school or library instead
People like us are the real solution to bridging that digital divide
Overcoming the digital divide not only involves confronting and understanding the combination of socio-economic factors that shape our experience, but also helping others confront and understand those experiences
By getting into IT you’ll help serve those in your communities, and organizations, and maybe even inspire a new generation of IT pioneers.
“When I think about solving the digital divide, I can't help but think of all the opportunities and breakthroughs that folks from diverse backgrounds and perspectives in the industry can bring.” - Kevin Limehouse
